- `submission.csv` - Test set predictions (ready for submission)

### Key Features

1. **Three Deep Learning Models**:
   - CNN with multi-filter convolution (filters: [3,4,5], 100 filters each)
   - BiLSTM with 2 stacked layers (256 hidden units, bidirectional)
   - Attention-BiLSTM with attention mechanism for interpretability

2. **Data Handling**:
   - Vocabulary: 14,908 words
   - Sequence length: 200 tokens (covers 91.3% of reviews)
   - Stratified train/validation split (85/15)
   - Class weight handling for 6:1 imbalance

3. **Training Configuration**:
   - Optimizer: Adam (lr=0.001)
   - Batch size: 64
   - Epochs: 15 (with early stopping)
   - Learning rate scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau
   - Loss: Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy

4. **Model Performance**:
   - Best model: Attention-BiLSTM (89.09% accuracy)
   - F1-Score: 0.939 (excellent class balance)
   - Inference speed: 0.75 ms per sample

### How to Use

#### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Train Models
```bash
python train.py
```
Generates: `best_*.pt` files with trained model weights

#### 3. Generate Predictions
```bash
python predict.py
```
Generates: `submission.csv` with test predictions

#### 4. Complete Pipeline
```bash
python run_all.py
```
Combines training and prediction in one script

### Results Summary

✅ All three models trained successfully
✅ Attention-BiLSTM selected as best model (highest accuracy and F1-score)
✅ submission.csv generated with 1851 test predictions
✅ Training progress logged and documented
✅ Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore
✅ All source code and documentation committed

### Ready for GitHub Upload

The project is ready to be pushed to GitHub at:
https://github.com/TSWtswTSWtsw123/6483_mini_project

Note: Model files (*.pt) are excluded via .gitignore as they can be regenerated by running `train.py`
